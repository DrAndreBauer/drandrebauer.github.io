Our research paper, "Microservice Applications and Their Workloads on GitHub", has been accepted for presentation at the 8th Workshop on Hot Topics in Cloud Computing Performance ([HotCloudPerf](https://hotcloudperf.spec.org)). Many cloud applications use microservices for scalability and flexibility, but their distributed nature poses challenges. Performance engineers rely on representative applications for evaluation, yet existing benchmarks are limited and their industry relevance is debated. To explore alternatives, we mine GitHub for microservice applications and workloads, creating two datasets: 553 applications and 8 workload repositories. Our analysis offers a foundation for future research in microservice benchmarking.
