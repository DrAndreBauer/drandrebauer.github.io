Our research paper, "TACO: A Lightweight Tree-based Approximate Compression Method for Time Series", has been accepted for presentation at the 14th International Conference on Data Science, Technology and Applications, DATA ([DATA 2025](https://data.scitevents.org)). As time series data is growing, storage and transmission are major challenges. 
We present TACO: a fast, training-free, tree-based compression method. In comparision to the state-of-the-art, it has no strong assumptions and offers selective decompression.
