<summary>PhD Position in Performance Engineering for Containerized System & Serverless Computing</summary>

### PhD Position in Performance Engineering for Containerized System & Serverless Computing  

I am seeking a highly motivated PhD student to contribute to research in containerized system optimization, serverless computing, and scientific computing acceleration. 

#### **Research Focus**  
The successful candidate will work on topics related to:  
- **Containerized system optimization & co-simulation** – Developing and evaluating performance models for Kubernetes deployments, enhancing orchestration strategies, and leveraging co-simulation techniques for system analysis.
- **Serverless computing optimization** – Investigating the performance trade-offs of serverless architectures, optimizing cold start behavior, and improving resource allocation strategies in dynamic environments.
- **Scientific computing acceleration** – Addressing computational bottlenecks in cloud-based scientific workflows and optimizing the execution of complex simulations.

#### **Your Profile**  
I am looking for candidates with:
- A Bachelor's/Master’s degree (or equivalent) in Computer Science, Engineering, or a related field.
- Strong background in cloud computing, distributed systems, or performance engineering.
- Experience with container orchestration platforms (e.g., Kubernetes, Docker) and serverless computing frameworks.
- Proficiency in programming languages such as Python, Go, or C++.
- Familiarity with performance modeling, simulation frameworks, or time series analysis is a plus.
- Excellent communication and teamwork skills.

#### **What We Offer**  
- A fully funded PhD position within an internationally recognized research environment.
- The opportunity to contribute to cutting-edge research in cloud and serverless computing.
- Collaboration with leading academic and industrial partners.
- Access to high-performance computing resources and cloud platforms.
- Support for conference travel and research dissemination.

#### **Application Process**  
To apply, please send the following documents as a single PDF to [abauer7@iit.edu](mailto:abauer7@iit.edu):  
- A cover letter explaining your motivation and research interests.  
- A detailed CV, including relevant coursework and publications (if any).  
- Contact information for at least two academic references.  
- Copies of academic transcripts.  

Review of applications will begin immediately and continue until the position is filled. For further inquiries, feel free to contact me.
