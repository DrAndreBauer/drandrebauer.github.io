I believe the future can be shaped by research and educating the next generation, making teaching a vital part of my academic life. As a researcher and lecturer, I aim to inspire students with a balance of scientific theory and practical knowledge. Theoretical foundations help them grasp current and emerging technologies, while practical insights connect them to real-world applications and research.
